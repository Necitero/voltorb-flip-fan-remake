# Voltorb Flip Fan Remake

This is a fan remake of the Pokemon HG/SS minigame "Voltorb Flip" made in Vite + React TypeScript.

## Pretext

### The project

This project aims to be a learning project for myself, as I want to code more outside of work. Thus, I do not plan on monetizing this project, nor do I want anyone to redistribute anything from this project for monetary gain.

This project will remain open-source for anyone who wants to see how I made this game happen, but if needed, I will change the game, especially name and assets, to not break anyones intellectual property.

That being said: Again, this is a homage to the original minigame, which is intellectual property of the amazing designers, developers, texters and designers at Pokemon Company.

### Myself

I am a professional front-end developer who has been working on already existing projects for a few years. As I haven't had the chance to setup a lot of projects and logic foundations yet, I cannot say my code is 100% optimized. Learn from my best-practices, as well as from my mistakes.
